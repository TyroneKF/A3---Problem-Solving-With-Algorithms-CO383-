## What is Normal Polish notation (NPN)?
In this project we had to code Normal Polish notation (NPN) which is (totally not copied from wikipedia);

The expression for adding the numbers 1 and 2 is written in Polish notation as + 1 2 (pre-fix), rather than as 1 + 2 (in-fix). In more complex expressions, the operators still precede their operands, but the operands may themselves be expressions including again operators and their operands. For instance, the expression that would be written in conventional infix notation as

(5 − 6) × 7
can be written in Polish notation as

× (− 5 6) 7
Assuming a given arity of all involved operators (here the "−" denotes the binary operation of subtraction, not the unary function of sign-change), any well formed prefix representation thereof is unambiguous, and brackets within the prefix expression are unnecessary. As such, the above expression can be further simplified to

× − 5 6 7

## What is in the folder?
In this repository there is;

• An assignment brief which may be a word doc, pdf.

• A BlueJ version of project in a Zipped Folder.

• A Jar file of the project.

These projects were originally created in BlueJ which may mean you might have to download Bluej to view the files. However, there is a Jar file in the folder which can be used to open, extract and view the code by using certain softwares.
